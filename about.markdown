Hi! My name is Robinson. I'm a 4th year currently attending Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major. My cybersecurity journey has just begun, but I am interested in penetration testing and anything DFIR related.

This blog is going to be about anything related to cyber security and technology that interests me. I want to make this blog a good resource for those interested to learn about security topics in depth. Expect to see detailed walkthroughs of my ventures into this field!
