Hi! My name is Robinson. I'm a 4th year CIS major currently attending Cal Poly Pomona. My cybersecurity journey has just begun, but I am interested in penetration testing and anything DFIR related.

This blog is going to be about cybersecurity and technology I find interesting. I want to make my blog a good resource for those interested to learn about cybersecurity topics in depth.
