Hi! My name is Robinson. I'm a 4th year CIS major at Cal Poly Pomona. I'm interested in penetration testing and anything DFIR related.

This blog is going to be about cybesecurity and technology I find interesting. I want to make my blog a resource for those interested to learn in depth about cybersecurity topics. Expect to see detailed walkthroughs about my ventures into this field!
